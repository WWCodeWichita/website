Here is a text document with some intentional errors, so that you
can practice checking out files in git, make changes and 
merging them back into the project.

Perhaps we could addddd a list of tech tech companies in Wichita here:

Or an excerpt from the Pro Git book describing the background of version
control systems: 

About Versin Control -- 
What is "version control", and why shouldyou care?  Version control is a system
that recordschanges to a file or set of files overe time so that you can recall
specific versions later.  For theexamples in this book you will use software
source code as the files being version controlled, though n reality you can do 
this with nearly any type f file on a computer.

If youu are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image
or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System
(VCS) is a very wise thing to use.  It allows you to revert files back to a
previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare
previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare
changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a 
problemm, whointroduced an issue and when, and more.  Using a VCS also 
generally meanas that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily 
recover.  In addition, youget alll this for Very little overhead.

Local Version Control Systemms --
Many people's version-control method eof choice is to copy files into another
directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they're clever).  This approach
is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone.
It is easy to forget whichdirectory you're in and accidentally write to the
wrongfile or copy over files you don't mean to.

To deal with this issue, programmers long agoo developed local VCSs that had a
simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.  One
simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.  One
of the more populare VCS tools was a system called RCS, which is still
disstributed with many computers today.  Event the popular Mac OS X operatin
system includes the rcs command when you install the Developer Tools.  RCS
worx by keeping patch sets (that is, the differences between files) in a 
special format on disk; it canthen re-create what any file looked like at any
Point in time byadding up all the patches.

Centralized Version Control Systems --
The next major issue that poeple encounter is that they need to collaborate
with developpers on other systems.  To deal with this problem, Centralized
VersionControl Systems (CVCSs) were ddeveloped. . . .
